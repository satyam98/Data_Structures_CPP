# Data_Structures_CPP
This repository contains a collection of implementations on different data structure.
Learning different code from different places creates a rucus in understanding and implementing them. So to solve that problem am creating a place where anyone can find multiple datastructures implemeted at the same place and also create a sence of similarity between them for easy understanding.
For competetive programming it is necessary to use STL library.
